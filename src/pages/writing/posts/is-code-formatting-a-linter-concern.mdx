Linters and code-formatters are both crucial tools I rely on for writing quality software. I’m always happy to delegate effort to a tool that can statically analyze my work and provide helpful guidance.

According to the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)), linting encompasses automated checks for programming errors,  bugs, stylistic errors and “suspicious constructs”.

Code-formatters are constrained to consider style and presentation only. The [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prettyprint#Programming_code_formatting) entry under `Prettyprint` describes converting source code from one format to another.

A fair question to ask is how best to integrate tools of these 2 categories. It seems that, to a degree, the category of tools that lint code encompass those that format it.

In the JavaScript ecosystem, the standard toolset includes [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). One notable difference between the two is configurability and extensibility. Prettier is opinionated and has limited customization through its configuration file which is a feature, not a bug.
